<h2>About Business Glossaries in TopBraid EDG<a class="headerlink" href="#about-business-glossaries-in-topbraid-edg" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>A glossary is a collection of terms in a particular domain (i.e., field or subject) of knowledge with the test definitions for those terms.
Unlike dictionaries, which are more general collections of words, glossaries only concern themselves with terms that will enhance one’s comprehension of a certain topic.
Glossary terms are often highly specific to a particular business subject or area of operation.
They could be thought of as a ‘jargon’.
Just about any business activity and organization you can think of has its own jargon to go with it – from professional disciplines to operational activities.</p>
<p>A business glossary goes beyond just a list of terms.
Linking terms to IT assets establishes a connection between business and IT and enhances organizational collaboration.
Glossary lets you create and manage a common vocabulary of terms important to your organization to ensure clear communication and improve productivity.
These terms can be categorized in a way that is relevant to your organization.
Multiple glossaries can be developed, interlinked, searched and explored.
Valid definitions of values and business rules can then be managed and made available across the organization.</p>
<p>Glossary terms can be a ‘flat’ alphabetical list or they can be organized into hierarchies.
In TopBraid EDG, the primary user interface (UI) for viewing and editing glossary terms looks like a spreadsheet.
TopBraid EDG also supports a category of vocabularies that are called <em>Taxonomies</em>.
Depending on your licensing, you may see this category of asset collections in your installation of EDG and, as a result, may wonder about the difference between Glossaries and Taxonomies and when to use each – especially, if your terms are organized hierarchically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unlike <em>Glossaries</em>, <em>Taxonomies</em> always assume that terms are organized and presented as hierarchies and that the hierarchical relationship between them is “broader concept” which is defined by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a> standard.
SKOS doesn’t use the word “term” that is common to business glossaries.
Instead, it uses the word “concept”. Further, each <em>Taxonomy</em> defines at least one <em>concept scheme</em>.
A concept scheme points to its top concepts.
The primary user interface for viewing taxonomies is hierarchical.</p></li>
<li><p>Even more importantly, <em>Glossaries</em> are designed to improve understanding of data’s context and usage.
Glossary terms not only have descriptions of their meaning, but they also define business context of use and can be linked to the underlying technical metadata to provide a direct association between business terms and data sources and data elements.
The underlying model or ontology for taxonomy concepts is SKOS.
The underlying model for glossary terms is EDG-provided glossary model.
It re-uses some of SKOS properties as appropriate.
For example, a property for alternative labels of synonyms and properties for various notes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In TopBraid EDG, glossary terms include description of business rules and permissible values – both, in plain English as well as in structured, executable rules that are used to automate connections between data elements and business terms.
They may also connect to reference datasets and enumerations that hold lists of values specific to a given term such as “customer status”.
Taxonomies, on the other hand, describe some domain of knowledge in general.
They are often focused on providing a rich set of synonyms that are used in search, text mining and document classification.</p>

<h2>Access the EDG Application<a class="headerlink" href="#access-the-edg-application" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>To work through this guide, use a browser to access the EDG web-application running in one of the following environments.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create an EDG trial evaluation at TopQuadrant, and run EDG from the TopQuadrant servers.
Submit an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-enterprise-data-governance/request-edg-evaluation-account/">EDG evaluation request</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.topquadrant.com/get-started-data-governance/">contact TopQuadrant</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use TopBraid Composer – Maestro Edition (TBC-ME), and run its demonstration version of EDG.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.topquadrant.com/topbraid-composer-install/">Download</a> and install TBC-ME.
If using sample data, you will need to download and install EDG samples project.</p></li>
<li><p>Install EDG on a server accessible to your network (which could also be a local Tomcat server, via localhost).
For a custom install, contact TopQuadrant and see EDG Server Installation and Integration.
If using sample data, this will also require separate installation of the EDG samples project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the TBC-ME option, launch TBC-ME and then start the demo version of EDG via the top menu: TopBraid Applications &gt; Open TopBraid EDG.
Browse to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:8083/tbl">http://localhost:8083/tbl</a>.
Logging in as Administrator requires no password for the demo version.
All asset collection types are available in the demo version.</p>
<p>For the other two options, the system administrator or TopQuadrant will provide you with a URL, a username, and a password.
Browse to the URL and log in.
Server licensing will determine the availability of the various asset collection types.</p>

<p>Governance areas organize glossaries (and other EDG asset collections) according to either business-oriented or data-oriented concerns.
The areas can have associated governance roles, which help business teams to coordinate their management of the area’s collections via defined workflows.</p>

<p>From now on, a logged in Administrator (user ID) carries a governance role of Data Steward for the Customer Data Domain area.
The scope of this role is any asset collection in the area.
Governance roles can also be defined at the level of an individual glossary and even individual asset.
They not only document responsibilities, but also determine what users can do as part of the workflows that are defined using governance roles.</p>

<h2>Getting Started for the Steward<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-for-the-steward" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>As a steward you need to be able to create and maintain glossary datasets.
This part of the document will briefly explain you how to do that.</p>

<h3>Creating, Populating and Changing a Business Glossary<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-populating-and-changing-a-business-glossary" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<section id="creating-a-new-glossary">
<h4>Creating a New Glossary<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-new-glossary" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>You can create a new glossary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Directly from the <strong>Governance Areas</strong> page by clicking on the area your new glossary should belong to and then choosing Glossary in the <strong>Choose Type</strong> drop down.
Your newly created glossary will be automatically connected to the subject area.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also click on the + icon in the header and the select Glossary from the drop down of asset collection types</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can click on the <strong>Glossary</strong> asset collection in the left menu and click on the “Create New Glossary” in the top of the screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, the Create dialog will ask you for the glossary name (label).
You can also add a description and specify a “default namespace”.</p>
<p>The default namespace is used to formulate URIs for the glossary terms.
Every asset managed by TopBraid EDG has a globally unique web identifier – a URI.
People and applications can link and refer to this URI in a similar way to how web pages can link and refer to each other.
URIs can be dereferenced by people and applications.
This means that submitting a URI will return either a web page with its information or a data object representing it.</p>
<p>You can also select the preference for your instance data URI settings at the collection level.
This will override the default set by and Administrator.</p>
<p>TopBraid EDG will pre-populate the default namespace field with a default that you can change.
Let’s name our glossary “Customer Data Glossary” and add the following description: “A multi division effort to consolidate all customer related terminology.”
Click on <strong>Create Glossary</strong> button.</p>

<h4>Viewing and Changing Information about a Glossary<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-and-changing-information-about-a-glossary" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>If you used the second method of creation, you may want to add more metadata about your new glossary such as the governance area it belongs to.</p>
<p>You can do this either prior to importing data into our glossary or at any point after importing.
To update glossary metadata, go to the home icon in the editor to refresh the form panel for the collection itself, add a Customer Data Domain to a subject area in the form. Save changes.</p>
<p>Here, you will also see other information about the Glossary – such as its URI, what other asset collections include it, etc.

<p>This could be fixed directly in the glossary or can be done in a context of a workflow (with an associated working copy) that would store the information about changes to the glossary term.
This way, all changes go through a workflow process enabling collaboration and better control over data.
EDG uses the following terminology:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>production copy</strong> is the master version of the glossary.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>working copy</strong> is a virtual copy of the glossary created for editing purposes.
A working copy gets created when a new workflow starts and is associated with that workflow.
Changes you make in the working copy will go through a workflow approval process described in the workflow template.
At the end of the process changes typically get published to the production vocabulary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Several workflows, each with its own associated working copy, may be in progress at the same time as users in various roles make and review changes in those working copies.
All working copies can be accessed from glossary’s Workflows tab that displays workflows in progress.
TopBraid EDG offers a built-in workflow template (called Basic workflow).
You can also add custom workflows to EDG.</p>
<div class="admonition seealso">
<p class="admonition-title">See also</p>
<p>More information about it can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.topquadrant.com/7.0/workflows/">Workflows</a> section</p>
</div>
<p>When you make changes directly in the glossary, your changes will be immediately visible to everyone using the glossary.
They will also show up in any working copy created for the glossary.
When you make changes in a context of a workflow, they are kept in the workflow’s working copy.
Thus, changes will only be visible in that workflow.</p>
<p>EDG users with the appropriate permissions can choose between making changes directly to a glossary and using workflows to make and review changes.
You can start a workflow for a glossary as a whole or for a particular term in a glossary.
We will do the latter.</p>
<p>Single click on the <strong>Customer ID</strong> term to have its form open in the right panel.
Click on the <strong>Available actions for this</strong> button and select <strong>Start Workflow</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p>In the dialog that appears, name the workflow “Customer ID description” and click on <strong>Submit</strong> button.
If your installation has more than one workflow template that is applicable to glossaries, you will get a chance to select the type of workflow.
After the workflow is created you will see <strong>Workflow Status and Transitions</strong> page.
You can always come back to this page by clicking in the gear icon in the header (located to the left of the <strong>Terms</strong> tab).</p>
<p>You know that you are now in the context of a workflow because the color of the header menu changed to yellow.
Click on the <strong>Customer ID</strong> link in the header.</p>
<p>This will open a form for <strong>Customer ID</strong> term.
Click on an <strong>Edit</strong> button in the right top menu of the right pane.
Add the following definition: “Customer ID is a 5 character alphanumeric field exactly identifying a customer” and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
<p>Click the <img alt="panels" src="../../_images/panels.png" /> dropdown located in the header of the page, drag <strong>Change History</strong> panel (under Reports) and drop it into the page.
Click on the Refresh icon in the panel to see the log of changes.
Click <strong>On selected</strong> button to only see edits that were made to the currently displayed term.</p>
<p>Clicking on the gear button to the left of the <strong>Terms</strong> tab will return you to the Workflow Status page.
Now that you made some changes, you will see more actions available to transition the workflow to a next state.
You can <strong>Freeze for review</strong> and you can also directly <strong>Commit changes to production</strong>.
The former action will put the workflow in the state where no more changes can be made.
It is designed to let responsible parties review the content and either approve or reject it.
They could also unfreeze the workflow opening it to further changes.
The latter action will complete the workflow and write all changes to the Glossary.</p>
<p>To exit the workflow in progress and come back to the current (AKA production) version of the Glossary, click on the <strong>x</strong> button to the right of the <strong>Customer ID description</strong> in the header at the top of the page.</p>

<h4>Creating and Including Ontologies<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-including-ontologies" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
<p>Metadata available for each glossary term in EDG is defined in an ontology.
If you are satisfied with properties that are provided for glossary terms, then you don’t need to modify the glossary ontology.
However, you may want to add new fields (properties) or remove existing fields.
You can address this by creating an extension to the pre-built TopBraid EDG glossary ontology.</p>
<p>To do so, click on the + icon in the header and <strong>Create New Ontology</strong>.
You can name it <em>Glossary Ontology Extensions</em> or select another name of your choice.</p>
<p>Include the TopBraid EDG Glossary model in the new ontology.
Go to <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click on an <strong>Includes</strong> to see the pop-up window.
