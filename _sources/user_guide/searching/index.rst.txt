Searching in EDG
================


Search the EDG searches across all EDG resources that EDG administrator and/or manager of a specific collection elected to include in the index.
This decision can be made upon creation of a collection and can also be made later on the Manage tab of the collection or through Governance Model.
An entire subject area or business area can be included in Search the EDG by checking the box as shown below.

Submitting a search from the home page opens a page with the search results summary.
Your search key words will be matched against text in any of the properties of the collections that are managed by Search the EDG.

.. note:: You may have fields that contain text tagged with different languages, note that search will be performed across all values, irrespective of the language.

In the search results page, you can:

* refine or completely change the search terms and re-execute the search,

* filter results via facets,

* click on any of the result results to see more information about it,

* make comments about any of the found resources and see comments made by other users,

* endorse any of the found resources and see endorsements made my others,

* access interactive visual views and diagrams for a found resource – what is available depends on a type of the item,

* access results and facets via API’s (see below),

* search using Lucene query expression.

All properties of the collection will be indexed for search as well as applicable facets.
The results of search are sorted by score, then alphabetically.
The facet results list shows the top 10 facets for the results.
The score is calculated based on the number of matches to the term within the document.
Lucene also offers query boosting per field (be sure to check use advanced syntax).

For example searching:

::

 *id^3 -will find anything that ends in "id" and assign it a weight of 3, boosting those results
