Viewing Metrics Dashboards
==========================

Metrics Dashboards available from the left navigation menu of EDG, are used for visual representations of data in your EDG application.
Pre-built dashboards are available for workflows, governance subject areas and data elements.
Additional dashboards can be built as a customization to your EDG platform.

EDG administrators can activate metrics dashboards, using *EDG Configuration Parameters > Teamwork Platform Parameters > Metrics dashboards activated* (see :ref:`administrator_quide`).
And they can also edit the resulting **GOVERNANCE MODEL > Dashboards** item.
To activate each dashboard in the governance model, you will need to modify the Governance Model Collection.
The Default Dashboard contains each dashboard gadget such as Data Elements and Governance Roles.
Select “activate” to true.

.. note:: Creating new Metrics Dashboards requires advanced TopBraid developer knowledge in order to generate the scripts needed to supply data and add visualizations.
 Upcoming releases will include additional scripts for a variety of metrics.
