Working with Data Graphs
------------------------

Data Graphs are available as add-on module that can be combined with any package of TopBraid EDG.


Data Graphs Asset Collection Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Data Graphs is an asset collection type that supports general collections containing instances of classes defined in customer-specified ontologies.
This means that an organization decides what data to store in a data graph.



When creating a new Data Graphs collection, the creator selects the (top-level) Ontology upon which it is based.
Ontologies can include other ontologies by reference and when using Data Graphs a single top-level ontology that includes others is assumed.
Users can then work with instances of classes from the selected ontologies that are:

1. Declared as being SHACL Node Shapes

2. Declared using **public classes** (directly, or through a superclass) in the **GraphQL Schema** section of the Ontology’s form, accessible using the “home” icon

After creating a new Data Graph, the **Main Class** can be specified on the **Manage** tab if desired.
This determines the default asset type (i.e. class) in the Search panel in the editor page.
This setting can be changed at any time.
All public ontology classes remain available in the type selector dialog.

.. seealso:: Please see the :ref:`asset_collections` for all the general features of asset collections such as import/export, editing, user permissions, reports and settings.
