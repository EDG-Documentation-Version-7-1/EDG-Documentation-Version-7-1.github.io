Working with Crosswalks
-----------------------

.. include:: ../licensing_and_enablement.rst

Overview of Crosswalks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Crosswalks let you create connections between the assets in two different collections.
This is especially useful for defining connections between two different standard vocabularies or between a standard one and a specialized local one.
Applications can use saved crosswalk connection data to enhance the use of either vocabulary by taking advantage of the connected data and metadata for search, classification, and other operations.

When creating a new Crosswalk, you will be asked to identify From and To collection.

For each of the two collections connected by a crosswalk (From and To), you will be asked to select the class of assets to be mapped.
By default, mappings will use *crosswalk:closeMatch* predicate.
However, a different mapping predicate can be selected on the **Manage** tab.

Mappings between two asset collections can be auto-generated.
This functionality is available in the Crosswalk Editor by clicking on the **Generate Mappings** button.
Mapping functionality is part of the Problems and Suggestions algorithms.
Thus, mappings will be generated by running **Problems and Suggestions** panel.
**Manage** tab lets you set an option to automatically accept mappings that have 100% confidence.

TopBraid EDG uses fuzzy matching on asset names to generate crosswalk mappings.
Alternative mapping algorithms can be added to TopBraid EDG.
Adding a new algorithm requires access to TopBraid EDG Java code and is currently supported only through TopQuadrant Professional Services.
If alternative auto-mapping algorithms are available in your installation of TopBraid EDG, users will be able to select them on the **Manage** tab.
