Working with Taxonomies
-----------------------

.. seealso::

 * Please see the :ref:`asset_collections` for all the general features of asset collections such as import/export, editing, user permissions, reports and settings.

 * Specific taxonomy only information is contained within this page.

.. note::

 * In the current EDG release, there are two choices for editors.

 * This documentation focuses on the “new editor”.

 * Please see the previous documentation at doc.topquadrant.com for the “old editor”.

A taxonomy is an asset collection based on SKOS, the W3C standard ontology designed for representing taxonomies, thesauruses, and subject heading schemes.

In EDG, Taxonomies are SKOS-based datasets, whereas other datasets typically do not include SKOS, although they may.
When a new taxonomy is created, EDG will automatically include in it SKOS ontology.
SKOS provides a definition of concept classes (types) and their properties e.g., fields like preferred and alternative labels, various notes and relationships.

Every taxonomy is expected to have at least one concept scheme that identifies “top concepts” in a scheme.
A taxonomy can have multiple concept schemes; however, a better practice can be to use a single concept scheme per individual taxonomy.
Since taxonomies can, as all asset collections, be included into each other, a taxonomy with multiple concept schemes can be assembled through inclusion of several single concept scheme taxonomies.

Use of the pre-defined SKOS fields can be configured locally for a given taxonomy, globally for the entire EDG or for a subset of taxonomies e.g., all taxonomies associated with some business area.
You can disable fields for all or a group of taxonomies by taking advantage of the Ontology modeling functionality in EDG.
Rules and constraints specified by SKOS are also included by default as well as other common constraints for taxonomies e.g., a concept must have a broader parent or be a top concept of some scheme.
If desired, they can be disabled.

Ontologies are also used to define custom, non-SKOS properties for taxonomy concepts and to define specializations (sub classes of concepts).
If you customize SKOS, you need to make sure that the ontology with your customizations is included in the taxonomies these customizations apply to.
There is a system-wide setting your EDG administrator can use to ensure that the customized model is included in every new taxonomy.
If customization only applies to a subset of taxonomies, creator of a taxonomy can use the Includes dialog to include the desired customized model.
