Working with Corpora
--------------------

.. include:: ../licensing_and_enablement.rst

Overview of Corpora
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Corpus is a collection of textual assets, such as documents, excerpts, web pages, etc..
The original items are typically imported from external sources, such as content management systems or web sites and **typically are not created nor edited** within EDG.
The textual content of Corpus assets provides the foundation for manual or automated tagging and annotation using Content Tag Sets.
Corpora serve as the content graphs for Content Tag Sets.

Selecting the **Corpora** link in the left-navigation pane of TopBraid EDG lists all of the Corpus collections currently available to the user and allows authorized users to create new ones.

When working with Corpus collections users will have access to the same functionality as the functionality available for other asset collections e.g., ability to search, import, export, etc.
If a Corpus is created without specifying a connector to some content repository, users will be able to use EDG editor to create and edit documents in the Corpus.
Otherwise, the documents will come from an external repository and users will not be able to modify them.

.. seealso:: Please see the :ref:`asset_collections` for all the general features of asset collections such as import/export, editing, user permissions, reports and settings.
