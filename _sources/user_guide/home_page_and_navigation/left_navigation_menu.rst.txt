Left Navigation Menu
====================

The left navigation bar has three main sections: *Dashboard*, *Asset Collections*, and *Governance Model*.

.. index:: Dashboards

* *DASHBOARD*: This section provides access to Server Administration (if the user has Administrator privileges),
  it also provides two overviews of the current user’s work items: dashboards and workflows.
  It also contains links to basket with user selected items and three search tools: for particular asset collections, reference codes, and tasks.
  See below for details.

* *ASSET COLLECTIONS*: This section lists types of asset collections available in your EDG installation.
  When you click on the type such as Taxonomies, you will, as shown in the screenshot below, see all collections of this type that you have access to.
  These graphs contain the details of—and relationships among—various business and technical assets in the enterprise.
  As mentioned above, the availability of each collection type depends on EDG licensing (see `Best-Fit Data Governance`_ for details).
  When you click on a collection-type link EDG will display a page (home page for a collection type) that lists all collections
  on selected type and lets you create new collections e.g., as shown below, Taxonomies.
  If you do not see the Create New button, talk to your EDG Administrator. You probably have read-only access.
  For details of each collection type, see its documentation pages in either the page-tree (left) or the list above.

.. index:: Workflow Templates

* *GOVERNANCE MODEL*: This holds the Operational Governance Model defined for your TopBraid EDG solution.
  It includes overall structure of the organization, subject areas, roles, and users involved in Information Governance.
  It also contains links to Workflow Templates installed on your EDG server.

  .. seealso:: See :ref:`asset_collections` for more information.

  The version number is also stored below this section.
