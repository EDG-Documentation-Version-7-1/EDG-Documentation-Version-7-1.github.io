=============================

In addition to searching within each asset collection, EDG also lets you search across all collections. Options are detailed below.

  **TopBraid EDG Global Lookup View**

A *Global Lookup* text box In the page header lets you find assets (resources) across all asset collections in EDG by entering their name. This is an auto-complete look up field. As you type, any resource whose label is *prefixed* by the search text will appear in a popup list. Label and Preferred label with a language tag in the current browser’s language or with no language tag will be matched against the entered string.

Selecting a listed resource displays form with its information in a new browser tab – in the context of the collection where it is defined.

Search the EDG
--------------

Available from the home page, this searches across all EDG resources that EDG administrator and/or manager of a specific collection elected to include in the index. More details for Search the EDG can be found in the `User Guide:Search the EDG`_.
