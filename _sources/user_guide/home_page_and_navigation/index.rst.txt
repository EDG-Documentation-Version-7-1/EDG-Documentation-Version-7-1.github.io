****************************
EDG Home Page and Navigation
****************************

Many EDG views are oriented toward a particular type of asset collection, such as *taxonomy*, *ontology*, *data asset collection*, etc.
Every view has a header that provides breadcrumb navigation, global lookup, and special application links.
There is also a collapsible left-navigation menu and that provides direct links to all of the asset collection types and to
other top-level functions and views.
The entire left-navigation menu can be toggled down to icons via the left-arrow at the top, and the main menu sections
can be expanded/collapsed by selecting the +/- |dashboard nav bar| in the top right hand corner of the section.
