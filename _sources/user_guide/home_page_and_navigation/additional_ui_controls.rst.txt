  **TopBraid EDG Additional UI Controls**

1. *“Hamburger menu”*: The header’s three-bar “hamburger” icon drops down a quick-navigation menu for direct access to any asset collection you have access to.

2. *Toggle left-nav labels*: The left/right arrow atop the left-navigation menu toggles the text labels off/on, trading them for screen real estate.

3. *Special links*: The right-header has links to the user’s page, and help documentation.
