User Directory
==============

The list of all users defined in the EDG system can be shown by clicking on the **Users** link in the left navigation menu.
Each user listed can be clicked on to see their details.
Only users that have previously logged in to EDG are listed on this page, unless LDAP is configured in Server Administration.
For each user, the details are as listed in the following figure.
