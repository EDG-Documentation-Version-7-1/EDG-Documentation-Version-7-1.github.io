Deleting or Clearing an Asset Collection
----------------------------------------

Delete
^^^^^^

**Delete** is available under the *Manage* tab.
Delete removes the asset collection.
When selected a message to confirm the deletion appears and clicking OK deletes the asset collection including any working copies and history data.
If the collection is included by another collection it cannot be deleted and and error is reported showing the including collections.

.. note:: Use caution as this action is not recoverable without resorting to restore from backup.

Clear
^^^^^

**Clear** is available under the *Manage* tab.
Clear removes all content in the asset collection, including its history, working copies, comments, and tasks.
The empty collection itself, its includes and its user permission settings are preserved.
This feature can be used prior to import, for example, when replacing the collection content with an externally generated version.

.. note:: Use caution as this action is not recoverable without resorting to restore from backup.
