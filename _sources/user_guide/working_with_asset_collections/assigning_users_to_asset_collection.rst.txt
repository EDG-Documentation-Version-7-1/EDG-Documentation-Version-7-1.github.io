Assigning Users to an Asset Collection
--------------------------------------

The *Users* tab lists current permissions and roles for the asset collection or workflowâ€™s working copy.
For details on how permissions and roles work in TopBraid EDG, please see the Access Control documentation.

Users with at least **manager** profile use this page to modify roles and permissions, while it is read-only for other users.

.. index:: Permissions

Collection Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For any asset collection and a working copy of a collection in a context of a workflow, access to its basic viewing, editing, and utility functions is controlled by the three nested permission profiles: *viewer*, *editor*, and *manager* (where each profile is a superset of the preceding one).
On each collection, these permissions are set for various users, either as individuals or as security roles (e.g., from LDAP).

**Collection Permissions** section list the three permission profiles and, for each, users that have it.
A *blank* setting indicates that no users have this profiles.

In a context of a production copy of an asset collection, permissions can be set for any user.
In a context of a workflow permissions can be set only for users that already have (at least) a viewers privileges for the production copy.

A given user can have permission profiles for the collection itself (production copy) that differ from a profile for one of its workflows working copies.
Similarly, they could have different permissions in the context of different workflows.

For example, if Jane has **manager** profile for an asset collection, she can give John *viewer* profile for it and *editor* profile for one of its workflow copies.
John can then make changes in the context of a workflow.

A user that has any governance role for a collection is automatically granted viewer privileges for the collection and any of its workflows.
Users can also be designated as managers or editors through their governance role.

.. seealso:: For more information see the :ref:`data_governance_target` section of the documentation.

A user with multiple permission profiles on a given collection or workflow receives the greatest level assigned.

.. seealso:: See :ref:`rights_entailed_by_permission_profiles` for details.

Collection Governance Roles
---------------------------

This section lists governance roles assigned either directly for this collection or indirectly through a governance area it belongs to.

Users with **manager** profile can use this page to assign governance roles to other users: as individuals, as security roles (e.g., from LDAP), or as organizations.

.. seealso:: For details on governance roles, see :ref:`governance_areas_and_roles`.
