Basket
^^^^^^

Each user can maintain a personal list of “bookmarked” asset collections or individual assets in a *Basket*.
The *Basket* is available in the left navigation menu and in addition to quick reference, allows for individual or batch operations on collections.
Those operations are to create new versions of collections or export files in .ttl or .trig format to Amazon S3 buckets for external use.

To add a collection, open the collection and select the star icon in the collection’s header.
Re-selecting the star icon in the collection’s header will remove it.
When viewing the Basket, collections can be removed individually or as a group using the drop-down *Remove element*.
