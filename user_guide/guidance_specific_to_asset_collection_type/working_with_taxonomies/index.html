</div>
<p>A taxonomy is an asset collection based on SKOS, the W3C standard ontology designed for representing taxonomies, thesauruses, and subject heading schemes.</p>
<p>In EDG, Taxonomies are SKOS-based datasets, whereas other datasets typically do not include SKOS, although they may.
When a new taxonomy is created, EDG will automatically include in it SKOS ontology.
SKOS provides a definition of concept classes (types) and their properties e.g., fields like preferred and alternative labels, various notes and relationships.</p>
<p>Every taxonomy is expected to have at least one concept scheme that identifies “top concepts” in a scheme.
A taxonomy can have multiple concept schemes; however, a better practice can be to use a single concept scheme per individual taxonomy.
Since taxonomies can, as all asset collections, be included into each other, a taxonomy with multiple concept schemes can be assembled through inclusion of several single concept scheme taxonomies.</p>
<p>Use of the pre-defined SKOS fields can be configured locally for a given taxonomy, globally for the entire EDG or for a subset of taxonomies e.g., all taxonomies associated with some business area.
You can disable fields for all or a group of taxonomies by taking advantage of the Ontology modeling functionality in EDG.
Rules and constraints specified by SKOS are also included by default as well as other common constraints for taxonomies e.g., a concept must have a broader parent or be a top concept of some scheme.
If desired, they can be disabled.</p>
<p>Ontologies are also used to define custom, non-SKOS properties for taxonomy concepts and to define specializations (sub classes of concepts).
If you customize SKOS, you need to make sure that the ontology with your customizations is included in the taxonomies these customizations apply to.
There is a system-wide setting your EDG administrator can use to ensure that the customized model is included in every new taxonomy.
If customization only applies to a subset of taxonomies, creator of a taxonomy can use the Includes dialog to include the desired customized model.</p>

<p>For taxonomies, the default editor layout is the Taxonomy Concepts Panel tree view and the details Form Panel.
Just like the other collection editors, the UI for this editor can be customized and arranged and comes with many panels and layouts.</p>

<p>This panel displays taxonomy concepts organized into concept schemes.
It also lets you create new concepts and schemes.</p>
<p>A concept scheme provides an additional organizing context for a collection of concepts in a taxonomy.
A concept is said to belong to a concept scheme if it is a child (directly or indirectly) of a top concept.
Once a scheme is created, top concepts are added to it.
A concept must belong to at least one concept scheme in order to be displayed in the Taxonomy panel, but it can also belong to more than one, if needs be.</p>
<p>You can create concept schemes and concepts using icons positioned in the header of the panel.</p>

<p>Taxonomy Concept panel has a quick search field.
It lets you quickly look up concepts of interest.

<p>When you merge two concepts or concept schemes, you’re deleting one and moving its property values to another.
For example, let’s say you have a concept with a preferred label of “Caribbean” selected on the concept hierarchy, and it has a scope note value of “Does not include Greater Antilles”.
To merge it into the “West Indies” concept, transferring the property values to it, select Caribbean on the Concept Hierarchy and then select Merge into concept…” from the gear menu at the top of the form.
Enter “West Indies” in the dialog box that displays and press Enter.</p>
<p>When you are finished, the Caribbean concept will no longer be there, and the West Indies one will have a scope note value of “Does not include Greater Antilles” (if it didn’t already) as well as any other values formerly assigned to Caribbean.
Also if Caribbean was used by some other vocabulary (including transitive imports and usages in Tagger graphs) then those references there are also updated.
One exception is the Caribbean concept’s preferred label value of “Caribbean”, which instead of becoming an additional preferred label for “West Indies”, will become a new alternative label for it, because a concept should not have two preferred labels in the same language.</p>
<p>From version 5.2, merge also has a transitive side-effect such that if Concept A is merged into Concept B and A was used by some other vocabulary (including transitive imports and usages in Tagger graphs) then those references there are also updated.</p>

<p>Replacing the ID (URI) of an asset will move all information about it that exists in the current asset collection to the new ID.
This includes any references to the asset.
If no other collection refers to this asset then this operation will effectively delete the “old” ID.
However, any information about this asset contained in other collections will continue to refer to the “old” ID.
You should proceed with this operation only if all information about the asset is contained within this collection, or you understand the implications of this change and, if needed, are prepared to adjust other asset collections.</p>

<section id="cloning-and-replacing">
<span id="cloning-and-replacing-target"></span><h2>Cloning and Replacing<a class="headerlink" href="#cloning-and-replacing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Clone and Replace operations are available under Modify menu.</p>
<p>Clone creates a copy of the selected Asset.
The label of the clone (preferred label in case of SKOS Concepts) will be set as the label of original asset with “ Copy” post-pended to it.</p>
<p>Replace, creates a clone of the selected asset using URI that you will provide and then deletes selected asset.
One difference with the clone operation above is that the label will be the same as the label of the original asset, “ Copy” will not be postpended.
You can use this operation if you decide that you need to modify URI identity of a resource.
EDG will automatically adjust all incoming and outgoing references.
However, it will do so only for the currently selected asset collection.
Other asset collections will not be updated.
If they contain references to the asset you are replacing, you will see broken links.</p>

<span id="deleting-assets-in-taxonomies-target"></span><h2>Deleting Assets<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-assets" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>You can delete assets directly in an asset collection or you can start a workflow and delete in the working copy of the collection that is managed by the workflow.
Irrespective of the choice, delete options are the same.
See <a class="reference internal" href="../../workflows/workflows.html#start-workflow"><span class="std std-ref">Starting a Workflow</span></a> for the information on how to start a workflow.</p>
<p>With asset information displayed on a form, click on Modify button and select Delete.</p>
<p>You can also select Modify&gt;Delete by using a right click in the Classes, Node Shapes and Taxonomy Concepts panels.</p>
<p>For Taxonomy Concepts only, in addition to Delete, there is an option to Delete with descendants.
This deletes an entire tree starting with the selected concept.</p>
<p>Since asset collections in EDG can include each other by reference, some care needs to be taken when deleting assets.
Delete operation only deletes references to the deleted asset that exist in your current asset collection.
Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Taxonomy 1 defines Concept A</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomy 1 also defines Concept B making it a child of Concept A</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomy 2 includes Taxonomy 1</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomy 2 defines Concept C making it a child of Concept A</p></li>
<li><p>You go to Taxonomy 1 and delete Concept A. Concept B’s reference to A will be removed, but Concept C’s reference to A will stay.
Now concept C has a broader relationship to an undefined concept</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Running Problems and Suggestions report on Taxonomy 2 will report the issue and assist you in removing such references.</p>
<p>Similarly, deleting a class (asset type) from an ontology will not remove class instances (assets of a given type) that may be stored in another asset collection.
It will make them members of undefined class. Deleting a property does not delete property values that are held in another asset collection.</p>
<p>Running Problems and Suggestion report will help you identify and fix these issues.
Further, by going to the Settings&gt;Included By you will see all asset collections that include your selected collection.
You can then go to them and use References panel to identify what may be referring to a resource you are planning to delete.</p>
<p>In addition to generic import options, there is a taxonomy-specific import option that lets you import MultiTes files.</p>
<p>When importing RDF files into a Taxonomy, EDG will perform some transformations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Narrower concept” relationships will be used to generate inverse “broader concept” relationships</p></li>
<li><p>A Concept scheme will be added if none exists.
Concepts without broader parents will be made into top concepts of the scheme</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is done to ensure that such concepts are visible in the Taxonomy Concepts panel.</p>
<p>Hierarchical spreadsheet importers will also create concept schemes.</p>
<p>In addition to generic exports options, there are several taxonomy-specific export options.</p>
<p>In addition to create operations described in the Create New Assets and Clone and Replace sections, new taxonomy concepts can be created as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Select a parent concept, then select Modify&gt;Create multiple concepts…
Create multiple instance dialog lets you enter labels for new concepts – one label per line.
All labels must be in the same language.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a parent concept, then select Modify&gt;Clone with descendants …
This will clone an entire tree starting with the selected parent concept.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also see Taxonomy Concepts Panel for additional information.</p>
<p>When you create a child concept, you may want its type to be based on the type of a parent concept.
For example, you may want to make sure that all children of assets of type Continent are Countries.
To get this behavior, you need to specify a constraint on the ‘narrower’ relationship in the ontology your taxonomy is based on.
The constraint must be created on the inverse of skos:broader.
For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Go to the Geo Ontology and select Continent.
Then, create a property shape for inverse of skos:broader.
Do not modify the existing shape for inverse of skos:broader declared at Concept.
You want to create a new one, specifically for the Continent</p></li>
<li><p>In the create dialog, enter Country in the class field</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, when creating a child of a continent, you will no longer be asked to select a type, it will be automatically created as a Country.</p>
<p>In addition to the general reports, there are two specialized reports for taxonomies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Spell Check Report</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomy Statistics Report</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Displaying Relationship Trees<a class="headerlink" href="#displaying-relationship-trees" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>EDG’s taxonomy panel displays a hierarchical tree using “broader” relationships.
For example, if “dog” had a broader relationship of “mammal,” then the hierarchical tree would show “dog” as a child node of “mammal” on the tree.
You can also display a horizontal graphical tree using any relationship property you like by selecting <strong>Explore &gt; Display relationship tree</strong> from Form Panel on the editor.
EDG will then show a drop-down box that lets you select from all of the relationship properties used with the selected resource, and after you select one it renders a tree with all the concepts associated with that resource by that property.
If those concepts have their own values for that property, EDG will display then with a colored circle that you can click to see those values.</p>
<p>For example, in the following, someone has picked <strong>Display relationship tree</strong> after selecting Algeria in the sample Geography vocabulary and then selected the “has related” relationship.
Clicking the colored circle with “North Africa” turned that circle white and expanded the tree to show its own “has related” properties, and then clicking the colored circle for “Middle East” did the same for that concept.</p>

<p>The filled circles for Asia and Egypt show that clicking them would display additional values branching off from those.</p>
<p>To make room, you can collapse any expanded branch.
For example, clicking the white circle with “Middle East” above would turn the circle blue and hide its branches.</p>

<section id="skos-xl-taxonomies">
<span id="skos-xl-target"></span><h2>SKOS-XL Taxonomies<a class="headerlink" href="#skos-xl-taxonomies" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>SKOS-XL (SKOS eXtension for Labels) is a part of the W3C SKOS standard that lets you treat labels as resources in their own right, with their own metadata.
This may be useful for adding provenance data or information for text mining tools about how to use specific labels.
TopBraid EDG lets you use SKOS-XL to add any metadata you like to alternative and hidden labels.
Starting with release 6.3, EDG also lets you add metadata directly to links between a concept and its textual labels as detailed in <a class="reference internal" href="../working_with_ontologies/ontology_how_to_guidance.html#enabling-reification"><span class="std std-ref">Enabling Reification of Property Values</span></a> .
This may serve as an alternative to SKOS-XL – an alternative that supports capture of label metadata without the added complexity of managing labels as independent resources.</p>
<p>To activate the SKOS-XL support for a particular taxonomy, select Settings &gt; Includes and check SKOS XL SHACL Shapes to include SKOS-XL.
Then, when you edit concepts in that taxonomy, the edit forms will let you add existing label resources as the values of alternative and hidden labels.
Once a label’s data has been entered, it will appear like any other relationship property value on the relevant form: as a hypertext link.
You will be able create new labels using “Create New” as part of the editing concept information.
Or, alternatively, you can create and work with label resources independently from concepts.
To do so, switch to the Search panel (or Search layout) and select Label from the asset type navigator.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SKOS-XL SHACL Shapes only provide skosXL:altLabel and skosXL:hiddenLabel relationships so that you can create separate label resources for them.</p></li>
<li><p>A concept still needs to have a textual label.
This means that even with SKOS-XL, TopBraid EDG will continue to use skos:prefLabel as a direct label of a concept.</p></li>
<li><p>EDG uses resource’s textual label (either skos:prefLabel or rdfs:label) as a display name consistently across all the UI.
Further, TopBraid EDG creates text indexes of concepts (and other resources) to facilitate auto-complete and search.
The indexing process uses resource’s label.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>SKOS-XL defines only one property for the Label class – literal form.
As previously mentioned, EDG uses either skos:prefLabel or rdfs:label as resource names.
There is a special “hard coded exception” from this rule for the SKOS-XL Label resources.
Even-though the create dialog for them says “label”, the value entered as a label is stored in the skosXL:literalForm property.
EDG will understand that for Label resources this property is used as their name.
To associate a new property with a SKOS-XL label use the same Ontology customization capabilities as you would use to create new properties for concepts.</p>
<section id="transform-skos-xl">
<h3>Transform SKOS-XL<a class="headerlink" href="#transform-skos-xl" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
<p>On the Transform tab of Taxonomies you will find an option to convert SKOS-XL labels to reified values.
This feature will convert any instances of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:Label</span></code> to values of their corresponding <em>direct</em> SKOS properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:prefLabel</span></code> is converted to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skos:prefLabel</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:altLabel</span></code> is converted to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skos:altLabel</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:hiddenLabel</span></code> is converted to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skos:hiddenLabel</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:Label</span></code> has other properties than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:literalForm</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rdf:type</span></code> then these values will be converted into reified statements.
For example, if your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:Label</span></code> instances have values for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ex:isAbbreviation</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:prefLabel</span></code> was used to point to the label, then there will be a reified triple attached to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skos:prefLabel</span></code> statement to store these additional values.
The ontology should define suitable node shapes that define the properties such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ex:isAbbreviation</span></code> for display and editing purposes, and attach them to the property shapes of properties such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skos:prefLabel</span></code> using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dash:reifiableBy</span></code></p>
<p>Optionally, the original URIs of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:Label</span></code> instances will be stored as reified triples and the property <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dash:uri</span></code> which can then be used to restore the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">skosxl:Label</span></code> instances as part of an exporter.</p>
